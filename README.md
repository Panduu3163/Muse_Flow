## ⚠️ Before you read further

MuseFlow is a **personal hobby project**, not a commercial product. It has bugs. It's actively being worked on. It exists because I wanted to learn and build something I'd actually use — not to compete with anyone.

It also relies on unofficial/reverse-engineered access to some music platforms' internal APIs (details below), which exists in a legal gray area regarding those platforms' Terms of Service. This is the same trade-off made by several well-known open-source music apps this project draws inspiration and code from. Use accordingly.

### How music sourcing works

MuseFlow doesn't host or own any music. It resolves playable audio through a **provider-chain architecture** — multiple independent sources, tried and merged so no single point of failure takes down the app:

- **JioSaavn** — primary catalog source, public API
- **YouTube Music** — full authenticated streaming pipeline (visitor identity, BotGuard proof-of-origin token generation, signature/cipher deobfuscation) for access to YouTube's much broader catalog
- **LRCLib** — open, public API for synced lyrics

Each source is isolated behind a shared `Provider` interface, so if one breaks (which does happen — these are unofficial integrations reacting to platform changes), the others keep the app functional.

## 🙏 Credits & Acknowledgements

MuseFlow wouldn't exist without the open-source music-client community. Significant logic, architecture patterns, and research in this project were adapted from:

- [Metrolist](https://github.com/MetrolistGroup/Metrolist) — reference implementation for YouTube Music integration
- [zemer-cipher](https://github.com/ZemerTeam/zemer-cipher) — YouTube cipher deobfuscation and PoToken generation
- [SimpMusic](https://github.com/maxrave-dev/SimpMusic) — cross-reference for YouTube Music streaming
- [Echo Music](https://github.com/EchoMusicApp/Echo-Music) — architectural inspiration (provider-chain/fallback pattern, feature set)
- [LRCLib](https://lrclib.net) — synced lyrics API

Genuine thanks to the maintainers of these projects for their work being open enough to learn from.
